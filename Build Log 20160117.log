Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.

If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.

If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.

If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.

Purpose
=======

Spin up vagrant multi node routing environment and manage all nodes using Ansible. Upon spinning up vagrant will provision each node using Ansible to bootstrap the nodes. During the bootstrap each node will have a respective host_vars configuration file which will be updated with their eth1 address and ssh key file location. This allows you to run Ansible plays from within your HostOS or within any of your vagrant nodes.

Follow the "Hey I can DevOPS my Network too!" series on my blog at the following link. http://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/hey-i-can-devops-my-network-too-intro

Requirements
============

The following packages must be installed on your Host you intend on running all of this from. If Ansible is not available for your OS (Windows) You can modify the following lines in the Vagrantfile.

From:
````

#  node.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap_ansible.sh"

config.vm.provision :ansible do |ansible|
  ansible.playbook = "bootstrap.yml"
end
````
To:
````
  node.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap_ansible.sh"

#config.vm.provision :ansible do |ansible|
#  ansible.playbook = "bootstrap.yml"
#end
````

Ansible (http://www.ansible.com/home)

VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/)



Variable Definitions
====================

Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.

If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.

If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.

If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.
